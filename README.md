# Welcome to the Jubilee Austen Project GitHub Repo!

This is where I host the code from the Skillcrush project for the HTML & CSS module in the Front End Web Developer Blueprint.
Building this was really fun, and sometimes frustrating, especially when learning how to style and position with CSS.
I really enjoyed building this page, and it stands as one of the first projects I built for a 'class' while working alongside other students and getting help from Skillcrush Alumni and Mentors!
I plan to dig up all my notes I took when building this and maybe adding them here so I can see my thinking processes and troubleshooting process when building it.
